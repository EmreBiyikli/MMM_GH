Multiresolution Molecular Mechanics (MMM) is a software for the concurrent 
multiscale method with the same name. The method and software are developed 
at University of Pittsburgh by Emre Biyikli (biyikli.emre@gmail.com) and 
Qingcheng Yang (yqc0905@gmail.com) under supervision of Albert C. To 
(albertto@pitt.edu). 

For futher details about the code, see MANUAL.txt.
